# VIP Go Site Boilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xwp/vip-go-site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xwp/vip-go-site)


A modern setup for [WordPress VIP Go](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-go/) hosted projects:

- üè≠ Uses Composer for adding project dependencies, including plugins and themes.
- üåé Uses Composer autoloader for using any of the popular PHP packages anywhere in the codebase.
- üë©‚Äçüíª Provides a local development environment based on Docker that can be run inside Vagrant without having to install Docker on the host machine.
- üöÄ Includes automated build and deploy pipelines to WordPress VIP Go.


## Principles and Ideas

### Upstream Repositories for Deployment Only

Most enterprise WordPress hosts use Git repositories for tracking the website source code including the built Javascript and CSS files, and PHP dependencies which shouldn't be part of the development repositories. Therefore, we use the host's repositories only for deployment purposes. Deployments consist of all changes bundled into a single Git commit to a timestamp-based "release" branch in the host's repository from which we open a pull request to the deployement target branch.

### Reproducible Builds

Deployment process always starts from the same clean state which enables reproducable builds accross different environments such as local development machines and continuous integration services. See the "Deployments" section below for more details.


## Requirements

- PHP 7.2 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) or [Docker with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org) for deployments

We suggest using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for installing all project dependencies.


## Overview

- Project plugins and themes can be added as Composer dependencies or manualy to this repository under `public/plugins/your-plugin` and `public/themes/your-theme`.
- Composer dependencies are placed under `public/plugins/vendor`.
- Composer autoloader `public/plugins/vendor/autoload.php` is included in `public/vip-config/vip-config.php`.
- [Composer installers](https://github.com/composer/installers) maps WordPress plugins, themes and mu-plugins to sub-directories under `public`.


## Setup

1. Create a fresh Git repository from this reference repository:

		composer create-project xwp/vip-go-site --stability dev

2. Add your theme and plugins as Composer dependencies:

		composer require --working-dir=public your/theme your/plugin another/plugin

	or by manually copying them from existing repositories to `public/themes` or `public/plugins`. Remember to start tracking those directories by excluding them in `public/themes/.gitignore` and `public/plugins/.gitignore`.


### Local Development Environment

3. If using Docker inside Vagrant, adjust the hostname of the development environment in `Vagrantfile` to match your project.

		- config.vm.hostname = "vipgo"
		+ config.vm.hostname = "your-project"
	
	which will create the development environment at `your-project.local`.

4. Start the development environment using Vagrant:

		vagrant up

	or using Docker Compose:

		docker-compose up

5. Visit [your-project.local](http://your-project.local) (or the default [vipgo.local](http://vipgo.local)) to view the development environment. 


## Deployments

Deployments to the VIP Go upstream repository are handled by `scripts/deploy.sh` which does a clean checkout of the deploy branch to `deploy/src`, runs the build pipeline and copies the the `public` directory with the resulting artifects to `deploy/dist` (using `rsync`) which contains the upstream VIP Go repository. It then creates a new branch with the new changes and pushes it to the upstream repository.

### Configure Deployments

1. Change the repository URL for `deploy-staging` and `deploy-production` scripts in `package.json` to match your VIP Go upstream repository.
2. Adjust the build sequence in `scripts/deploy.sh` to match your setup.
3. Run `npm run deploy-staging` to deploy to the `develop` branch or `npm run deploy-production` to deploy to the `master` branch of the upstream VIP Go repository.
4. Visit GitHub to open a pull request to the deploy target branch.
