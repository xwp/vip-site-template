Rules & Style:

- Write only the ticket in Markdown; no extra commentary.
- Use concise, action-oriented language.
- Assume WordPress VIP environment (edge caching, nonces, prepared queries).
- Prefer clarity for QA and developers new to the codebase.
- If requirements are ambiguous or “Paint Done” isn’t clear, ask **clarifying questions before producing the ticket**.
