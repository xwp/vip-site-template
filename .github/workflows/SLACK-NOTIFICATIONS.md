# Slack Notifications

This document shows examples of Slack notifications sent by our GitHub Actions workflows.

## Configuration

Slack notifications are **optional** and require both:

- `SLACK_CHANNEL` repository variable (e.g., `#releases`)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` repository secret

If either is missing, workflows run silently without notifications.

## Setup

To enable Slack notifications, you need to create a webhook URL:

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App" → "From scratch"
3. Enter app name (e.g., "Client X Deployments") and select your workspace
4. Click "Create App"

### Step 2: Enable Incoming Webhooks

1. In your app settings, go to "Incoming Webhooks"
2. Toggle "Activate Incoming Webhooks" to **On**
3. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
4. Select the channel where notifications should be sent (e.g., `#releases`)
5. Click "Allow"

### Step 3: Copy Webhook URL

1. Copy the webhook URL (starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`)
2. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
5. Value: Paste the webhook URL
6. Click "Add secret"

### Step 4: Set Channel Variable

1. In the same GitHub settings page, click the "Variables" tab
2. Click "New repository variable"
3. Name: `SLACK_CHANNEL`
4. Value: Channel name (e.g., `#releases`)
5. Click "Add variable"

### Testing the Setup

- Push a commit to any protected branch or create a PR
- Check the configured Slack channel for notifications
- If no notifications appear, verify both `SLACK_CHANNEL` and `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` are set correctly
